======
The subdirectories found here we call datasets. They contain actual public
transportation networks.

The only exception is the directory "Template". It contains a template
for the datasets.

=== Global-Config.cnf =========================================================
Contains the default configuration values. They are overwritten by the local
configuration, typically found as */basis/Config.cnf, where * is the
corresponding dataset. To find out more about Config, have a look at the
documentation.
